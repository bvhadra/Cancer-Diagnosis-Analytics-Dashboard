    "This project analyzes breast cancer data to help improve diagnosis and treatment planning. Using a UK-based dataset of 2,000+ patients (METABRIC), we explore patterns in cancer outcomes and build tools to predict patient risks. The goal is to create an interactive dashboard that helps healthcare professionals make data-driven decisions."

    "1. **Molecular Subtype Hypothesis**: Breast cancer molecular subtypes will show significant differences in 5-year survival rates. We expect Luminal A patients to have >85% survival rate compared to <60% for Basal-like subtypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Age and Treatment Response Hypothesis**: Patients diagnosed under 45 years old will show different treatment response patterns compared to those over 70. Younger patients will have more aggressive tumors but better response to chemotherapy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Genomic Marker Prediction Hypothesis**: A combination of 3-5 key genetic markers will predict treatment outcomes with >75% accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Tumor Characteristics and Survival Hypothesis**: Tumor size and lymph node involvement will be stronger predictors of survival than patient age.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Treatment Optimization Hypothesis**: Machine learning models can identify optimal treatment protocols for specific patient subgroups."
