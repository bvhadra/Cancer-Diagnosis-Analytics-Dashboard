# Cancer Patient Survival Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores **cancer patient survival data** using **Tableau Public** to identify trends in **age, chemotherapy, tumor stage, and gene mutations** affecting survival rates.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Investigate **survival rates** among cancer patients.
- Analyze **the impact of chemotherapy** on survival duration.
- Evaluate **tumor stage** and its effect on survival.
- Explore **gene mutations** and their correlation with survival.
- Deliver an **interactive Tableau dashboard** for visualization.

## 🔬 Dataset Used
- **Dataset Name:** METABRIC Cancer Dataset
- **Source:** Publicly available cancer dataset with clinical and genomic data.
- **Key Features:**
  - Patient demographics (age, tumor size, tumor stage)
  - Treatment details (chemotherapy, gene mutations)
  - Survival status (Alive/Deceased)
  - Overall survival duration (Months)

## 🧐 Hypothesis
- **H1:** Patients who undergo chemotherapy have higher survival rates than those who do not.
- **H2:** Patients diagnosed at **earlier tumor stages (I & II)** have a higher survival probability.
- **H3:** Certain **gene mutations (e.g., BRCA1, BRCA2)** are associated with a **higher/lower survival probability**.

## 📊 Tableau Dashboard
An **interactive dashboard** was created using Tableau to analyze survival trends.

## 📈 Key Visualizations in Dashboard
1. **Survival Distribution (Bar Chart)** – Proportion of patients who survived vs. deceased.
2. **Age Distribution (Histogram)** – Patient age distribution at diagnosis.
3. **Chemotherapy Effect (Box Plot)** – Survival time comparison for chemotherapy vs. non-chemotherapy patients.
4. **Tumor Stage Impact (Stacked Bar Chart)** – Effect of tumor stage on survival rate.
5. **Gene Mutation Impact (Heatmap)** – Correlation between gene mutations and survival.

### 🔍 **Key Insights**
- **Older patients** tend to have lower survival rates, especially in advanced tumor stages.
- **Chemotherapy improves survival times**, but effectiveness varies based on tumor stage.
- **Higher tumor stages correlate with lower survival rates**.
- **BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations** show a correlation with survival outcomes.

### 🏆 **Final Thoughts**
This project provides **valuable insights for researchers and medical professionals** in cancer treatment strategies. Future improvements could include:
- **Machine learning models** for predictive survival analysis.
- **Expanding the dataset** to include other cancer types.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Data Cleaning & Analysis:** Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Data Visualization:** Tableau Public
- **Documentation & Reporting:** Jupyter Notebook, Markdown
